            When it comes to the rise of crypto collectors, it is no surprise that many secondary markets have emerged for the exchange of these unique assets.
            For those unfamiliar with non-fungible tokens (better known as NFTs), these are tokens that are unique to each other because of special features or identifiers that distinguish them from others in a similar set.
            Especially within DeFi, we have seen that NFTs play a role in tokenizing assets and contracts alike, all of which play a more significant role in the notion of composability — or different products interacting with each other towards a larger ecosystem.
            In this overview, we dive into twitter to find all Artist, Developers, and Content Creaters.

            On the platform, you can browse articles or search for something specific. You can also participate in an auction or even create your auction for items. While average sales have a fixed price, auctions usually sell rare or unsold items, which therefore have a higher rate.
            </br>
            The price of the items varies greatly depending on the type of thing which made it, whether there are discounts, etc. The same account will be able to buy or sell the digital assets, which means that you can sell them again once you have acquired the rights to their ownership. However, if you are a developer, you should read the next section, as the company has special rules for them.
